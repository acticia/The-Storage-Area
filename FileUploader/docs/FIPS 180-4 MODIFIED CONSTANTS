This document explains how the constants and the initial hash values are modified from the original FIPS 180-4
This method is promulgated in order to avoid use of pre-calculated hash values with standard known constants. 

















1. FIPS 180-4 defines
1.1. 64 constants 32-bits words
These words represent the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the cube root of the first sixty-four prime numbers.

1.2. 8 inital hash value of 32-bits words
These words represent the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the square root of the first eight prime numbers.

2. TSA defines

2.1. Entropy from the password

2.1. 64 constants 32-bits words
These words represent the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the nth root of the 64 follwing m prime numbers.

2.2. 8 intial hash value of 32-bits words
These words represent the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the (5-n)th root of the first 8 following prime numbers.
